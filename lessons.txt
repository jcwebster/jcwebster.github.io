Second time around... I got the updates I made pushed to Github.

I made the mistake of making a branch in cmd line, and I still don't know how to switch to it to work 'on it'.

Then I learned that you have to (in my still working knowledge):
git pull origin <branch> (updates your files) (git fetch does this if other authors are working on the project)
make your edits
git add
git commit -m "type msg like so"
and then....
git push origin <branch>, which would be master... until i figure out how to switch branches
