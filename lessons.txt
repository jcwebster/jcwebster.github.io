Second time around... I got the updates I made pushed to Github.

I made the mistake of making a branch in cmd line, and I still don't know how to switch to it to work 'on it'.

Then I learned that you have to (in my still working knowledge):
git pull origin <branch> (updates your files) (git fetch does this if other authors are working on the project) [must be a remote branchâ€¦ maybe try omitting origin next time]
make your edits
git add
git commit -m "type msg like so"
and then....
git push origin <branch>, which would be master... until i figure out how to switch branches


I've now gotten the hang of the editing routine. This is exciting.
I learned how to switch branches, push from a branch remotely and see that push to the repository online. See below.

after committing,
git push origin <branch you've edited on>
This is where i made a pull request and deleted <branch edited> online. However it still seemed to be present in cmd.
<!-- figure out how to delete a branch remotely here.-->
git checkout master
git pull origin master
All refreshed!
