Second time around... I got the updates I made pushed to Github.

I made the mistake of making a branch in cmd line, and I still don't know how to switch to it to work 'on it'.

Then I learned that you have to (in my still working knowledge):
git pull origin <branch> (updates your files) (git fetch does this if other authors are working on the project) [must be a remote branch… maybe try omitting origin next time]
make your edits
git add
git commit -m "type msg like so"
and then....
git push origin <branch>, which would be master... until i figure out how to switch branches


I've now gotten the hang of the editing routine. This is exciting.
I learned how to switch branches, push from a branch remotely and see that push to the repository online. See below.

after committing,
git push origin <branch you've edited on>
This is where i made a pull request and deleted <branch edited> online. However it still seemed to be present in cmd.
<!-- figure out how to delete a branch remotely here.-->
git checkout master
git pull origin master
All refreshed!

Pushing and Branches

The local copies of branches (on github) and the remote branches (on my laptop) are TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. When you work on master on your laptop, it is not the same master as on github.com. This means that even if you work directly on master on laptop, pull or git fetch origin first. This way you are working with the most updated branch. Likewise, when you push your updates from your laptop, they update the respective branch on github.com. 
Command:

git push origin <branchname>

Then, deleting a branch on laptop doesn’t delete it on github.com. To do so, use:

git push origin —delete <branchname>
