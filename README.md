# Personal-Website

My personal website can be found at matthewniedoba.com. The page is a relitively simple static web page highlighting my and experiences and personal projects as a software developer. The site was created using HTML5, CSS3 and javacript. Bootstrap was used for styling, with jquery used for some simple animation and navigation. Currently, the site is hosted on a AWS instance


If you'd like to check out the site, it is avaialable [here](http://matthewniedoba.com).
