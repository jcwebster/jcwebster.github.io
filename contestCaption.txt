I never imagined that four months could be as memorable as the time I spent in California. Amongst other great adventures, I had the opportunity to explore Yosemite National Park with my classmates. This picture was taken while I was filming a vlog on the last day of the trip exploring the valley floor with my friends, by chance wearing my new companyâ€™s shirt. I made invaluable connections and lived amazing experiences that I will treasure for the rest of my life. My friend took this picture of me in Yosemite National Park, on the last day of a weekend trip with my classmates. This picture was taken while I was filming a vlog on the last day of the trip exploring the valley floor with my friends. This photo captures a fraction of the endless memories I made with friends old and new in California in these short four months. My shirt just happens to be from ZBoard, the company I landed my dream internship at this term, designing electric longboards. At ZBoard, I made friendships that will last forever. I was always excited for co-op, but I never imagined that a term could be as epic as this. In my hand is the action cam that I brought on all of my weekly adventures.This photo captures a fraction of the endless memories I made with friends old and new in California in these short four months.My friend took this picture of me in Yosemite National Park, on the last day of our weekend trip with 6 other co-ops. This photo captures more than just the immense beauty of the forest.
