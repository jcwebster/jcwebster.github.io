I never imagined that four months could be as memorable as the time I spent in California. Amongst other radical adventures, I had the opportunity to trek through Yosemite National Park with my classmates. This picture was taken while I was minding my step and filming a vlog, and just happened to be wearing my new company shirt. This photo encapsulates every aspect of the sheer joy every week brought me. My friendships with classmates were strengthened tenfold through our adventures abroad together. I will treasure the memories I made over this co-op term for the rest of my life.
